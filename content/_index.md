I am PhD candidate in the Economics department at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, under the supervision of Dr. Sabien Dobbelaere and Prof. Dr. Jose-Luis Moraga Gonzalez. She holds a Research Master (2023) in Economics from the Tinbergen Institute (TI) and a MSc (2020) in Economics (track: Organization & Markets) from the Univesity of Amsterdam (UvA).

I will be on the 2026-2027 job market (placement director [Prof. Eric Bartlesman](https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/eric-bartelsman/)). You can find my cv here. My research work rests at the intersection of labor economics and empirical industrial organization. I am interested to understand the interplay between demand forces and firm labor outcomes. 

# Job Market Paper: Building Blocks: Conduct and Labor in the Prefabricated Concrete Industry

This paper explores firm conduct and labor outcomes in the Dutch prefabricated concrete industry amid growing housing demands. Using a novel dataset linking firm-level employee and production data, the study examines how firm interactions influence wages and pricing. Preliminary evidence from a post-cartel period suggests significant variability in prices and labor costs. Structural estimations of demand and production shed light on the implications of conduct assumptions. A calibrated simulation model assesses the potential market impacts of changes in labor dynamics, policy enforcement, and demand shocks. The findings aim to inform both academic literature and policy discussions on market behavior.


# Paper 2:  Labor Effects of Innovation Tax Breaks (with Sabien Dobbelaere)

Profit tax breaks from research and development (R\&D) activities, known as Innovation Boxes, are increasingly used worldwide as fiscal tools to promote innovation. While prior research has primarily focused on their impact on firms’ innovative output, evidence on labor market effects remains limited. This paper examines the labor effects of the Innovation Box policy in the Netherlands, using comprehensive firm-level administrative data linked to matched employer–employee records. We provide descriptive evidence using a staggered event-study design combined with a flexible matching procedure and strengthen these findings with an instrumental variables strategy that exploits the policy’s timing and exogenous profit variation. Our results show that reduced taxation of innovation profits raises labor income for incumbent workers through higher contractual wages and bonuses, consistent with a rent-sharing mechanism for retention. The effects are concentrated among high earners, thereby widening within-firm wage inequality. Firms do not expand post-treatment hiring but adjust their long-run workforce composition toward younger, more skilled STEM employees.

# Paper 3: Measuring Advertising Spillovers in the Automobile Industry (with Jose-Luis Moraga Gonzalez and Sandor Zsolt)

This paper examines the existence of advertising spillovers in the automobile industry. For this purpose, we formulate an empirical consideration set model of demand where advertising serves to increase buyer awareness. Each car model has an independent probability of being considered for purchase and this probability is influenced by a brand's own advertising, as well as the advertising of substitute models within the same brand, other brands within the same business group, and competing brands. We estimate the model using data from the Netherlands on regional car sales, prices, car advertising expenditures and car characteristics for the year 2008. We find evidence that own advertising increases the consideration probability of a car and that advertising spillovers are positive and sizable. These spillovers have important implications for firm strategy and market outcomes.
